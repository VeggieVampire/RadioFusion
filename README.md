# RadioFusion
RadioFusion is an innovative project that merges the world of amateur radio (HAM) with virtual reality (VR) technology. With RadioFusion, users can remotely access a Raspberry Pi-powered Software-Defined Radio (SDR) server using Soapy Remote backend technology. The frontend of the project is implemented as a Unity 3D game in VR, allowing users to immerse themselves in a virtual environment where they can interact with radio frequencies in real-time.

# Setup
## Hardware Needed
- Raspberry Pi 3 or 4
- RTL-SDR Blog V3 USB dongle
- VR Headset (such as Oculus Quest 2 or 3)

## Backend
**Set up Raspberry Pi as Soapy Remote SDR Server:**
   - Follow [this YouTube video tutorial from RickMakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJnRDu2_amU&ab_channel=RickMakes) to set up your Raspberry Pi as a Soapy Remote SDR server. This tutorial will guide you through the process of installing and configuring the necessary software on the Raspberry Pi, including connecting the RTL-SDR Blog V3 USB dongle.
